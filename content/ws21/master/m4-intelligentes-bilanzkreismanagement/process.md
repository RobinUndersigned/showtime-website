#### Scrum
Our entire project management was based on the Scrum framework. In order to be as flexible and organized as possible we structured the project into bi-weekly sprints.
Before each sprint we did an extensive sprint planning guessing story points which reflect the complexity of each user story. If needed we ended the sprint with a retrospective.

#### Research, User Interviews & User Testing
Since none of our team members initially knew what balancing group management is, we invested a small amount of time in researching the topic, understanding what the regular tasks of a balancing group manager is.

Our first goal was to keep the project as close to the user's needs as possible. Therefore and in order to get a better understanding of what the user actually needs we prepared a user interview.
Through Exxeta we were able to do the user interview with a balancing group manager. This helped us to understand the daily tasks of the user and what features would be important to have in a MVP.

During the evaluation of the user interview we clustered the results and extracted different features out of the information we gathered. These were then encapsulated into user stories which were the foundation of our sprints.
