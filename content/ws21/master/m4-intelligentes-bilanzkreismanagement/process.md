#### Scrum

Our entire project management was based on the Scrum framework. In order to be as flexible and organized as possible we structured the project into bi-weekly sprints.
Before each sprint we did an extensive sprint planning, guessing story points which reflect the complexity of each user story and defining what we want to get done within the sprint.
If needed we ended the sprint with a retrospective. Our process also included technical and functional reviews.

#### Research, User Interviews & User Testing

Since none of our team members initially knew what balancing group management is, we invested a small amount of time in researching the topic, understanding what the regular tasks of a balancing group manager is.

Our first goal was to keep the project as close to the user's needs as possible. Therefore and in order to get a better understanding of what the user actually needs we prepared a user interview.
Through Exxeta we were able to do the user interview with a balancing group manager. This helped us to understand the daily tasks of the user and what features would be important to have in a minimum viable product.

During the evaluation of the user interview we clustered the results and extracted different features out of the information we gathered.
These were then encapsulated into user stories which were the foundation of our sprints.

For our final user test we prepared a complete user flow through the application. The interviewee then was prompted small tasks that would require her/him to go through that user flow.
During the execution of those tasks we took notes on what went well and what problems the interviewee had to face when using the application.
We also payed close attention for feature and improvement suggestions that the interviewee would make.
As well as for the first interview, we again clustered all the notes and extracted future user stories for our application.

#### Our Design Process

The design process was straight forward as Katharina and Nhu already have had experience. With the help of **Figma**, the collaboration went smooth. In general, each one fiddled for herself at the beginning of each step. Afterwards, they came together and discussed their ideas, the advantages and disadvantages of the designs. After each bi-weekly sprint, the design decisions were presented to the whole team. We've had the opportunity to work with Daniel Heusohn, a UX-Designer from Exxeta, from whom we received valueable feedback.

The design process was as follows:

1. **Collect best practises and inspiration based on the user testing findings**
2. **Create a low-fidility prototype**
3. **Define the color scheme and typography**
4. **Create a high-fidility prototype**
5. **Create developer handoff page**

Starting with **collecting design inspiration and best practices** and utilizing the well prepared user stories as guideline, Katharina and Nhu then jumped into creating a **low-fidility protoype**. A simple hand drawn wireframe UI kit has been used, which consists of a minimum of needed elements to create anything one could have had imagen. They played with different variations of screen designs to weigh up which compositions might be the best fit, resulting in ten promising screens, which made it to the final cut.

Following the wireframes, they created a **high-fidility protoype**. Parts of the Pegasus Design System and Material Icons have been used, because of its clean and fresh design. Something worth emphasizing are the various form elements and buttons, which were designed from scratch to fit our color scheme and look.

#### Challenges

We were brimming with finite ideas, but due to time constraints we had to reduce ourselves to the most important features. With the help of the initially conducted user interview, we were then able to map a complete working flow with our MVP. Eventually, we were able to validate these ideas in a user test.
