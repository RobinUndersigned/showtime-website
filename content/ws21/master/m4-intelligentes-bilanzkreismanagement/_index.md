{{<section title="The Objective">}}
Balancing group management is a process in which so called balancing group managers try to balance power surplus and shortage by reducing or increasing the amount of electricity that's bought into the balancing group. The Exxeta Intelligent Balancing Group Management Dashboard supports the user's decision making by displaying power consumption forecast data generated by machine learning models in order to support a modern balancing group management.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
The team was made up of five people with diverse development backgrounds. Before the start of the project, only two of the five had actively worked on an Android App and Bluetooth development. To improve efficiency and speed, we split into two main focal points: One was setting up and ensuring a stable Bluetooth connection whereas the other dealt more heavily with the mathematical aspects of the project.
